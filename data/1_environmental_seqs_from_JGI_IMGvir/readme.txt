### WHAT, WHERE, WHEN
- Folder containing the data shared from Stephen Nayfach and Simon Roux (JGI).
- Raw data from Stephen Nayfach (and Simon Roux). Organization by Antoni Luque.
- Initial files: 2021-12-11
- Last files: 2021-01-14

### FOLDERS & FILES
FILE(s): email*.pdf
---> Files containing the correspondence with Stephen Nayfach and Simon Roux.

FILE(s): DTRs_20kb.*
---> Files associated with the small circular assembled contigs with direct terminal repeats (>50 bp) and at least one hallmark Caudovirales gene. *.fna contains the nucleotide sequences of each contig. *.csv contains information associated with the sources and number of contigs in each case.

FILE(s): biome1.*
---> Table-separated-value files containing information about the total genomic content for each virome, including all data in the original database (not just the small, < 20 kbp, circular contigs).


### HOW
!!!! I need to narrow the specific approach followed by Stephen Nayfach and Simon Roux. Here is what I have so far:
- Source IMG/M and GOV2
- Accession dates?
- Tool: CheckV (Nayfach et al bioRxiv, 2020)?
- Filter for circular genomes with DTRs (> 50 bp), genome lengths < 20 kbp, and one Caudovirales hallmark gene (list? annotation approach?).
